## What I do (or used to do)

I used to be crazy down the web developer pipeline. It got to the point where I would wake up, work on a website then sleep. Needless to say it wasn't healthy in the slightist. A few months after that I went to a new school and realized that making friends and hanging out with them is infinitely better than staying inside all day and doing web design. 

Nowadays I don't really have the time that I used to have to commit to webdev stuff. As a result, I'm guessing that this'll probably be the final iteration of this website.
