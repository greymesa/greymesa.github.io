hey all, i'm back. was busy cramming final assignments *(started an essay the night before it was due n turned it in one minute before the due date)* and studying for exams!!!! anyhoo i'm back now and in semester 2. 
<!--ex-->
shi seems aight but i have this absolutely abhorrent teacher that doesn't know what she's talking ab. 
wish me the best team.

ALSO in other news i'm finally getting back into web design kinda. working as a member of my local hackathon this year as a tech exec so thats nice. (would share the link to their or something but my ass is not trying to get doxxed)

also for you longtime followers of my antics, mesacomplex may be coming back sooner than later if i have the time. (mesaredux confirmed?!?!?!)

i've been way too busy with this one goated geopol minecraft server tho so ion know if i can juggle both with school. (shout out to <a href='ccnetmc.com'>ccnet</a>)

sorry i couldn't keep doing the capitalization thing it's too much for my brain to think about. (and i sounded like a 45 yr old white dude)

anyways that's all, i'm out till whenever i decide to write another one of these.
